# Windows Product Key Finder

This is a very simple GUI tool that displays your current Windows product key.

## Why?

It was created so that I can easily view the key before doing a system reinstall and prevent me from having to store the key in a file somewhere, only to get lost over time.

I also did not like the idea of downloading a random key finder tool from the web without knowing what it did.

Finally it gave me a chance to work with the Windows registry and learn some new code. 

## Compatibility

I plan to ultimately make this work with as many Windows editions as I can, but this requires access to those machines.

So far, the following Windows editions have been tested and are supported:

* Windows 7 
    * Home Premium Service Pack 1 64 bit
	
* WindowsXP 
    *Professional Service Pack 3 32 bit

If you use the code and find it works on other versions of Windows, please contact me and let me know.
